# awesome-mri-segmentation


In this repo I try to collect a list of papers that focus on the segmentation of MRI in various anatomies. This is still a early list and will be actively expanded.

This repo will mainly focus on the papers that utilizes Machine Learning techniques to perfrom MRI segmentation, so most of the papers in the list will be after 2019.

If you find any interesting works feel free to create pull requests or [*email* me](mailto:knight16729438@gmail.com) to make the list more comprehensive.
